## Overview ##

After building a basic static portfolio to learn front-end fundamentals, I migrated to a Next.js-based site for more flexibility and easier content management. I used an open-source starter template by Transitive Bullsh!t as a foundation, then customized the layout, navigation, and styling to reflect my personal branding and simplify updates.

## Key Features & Purpose ##

This project focused on deployment and usability rather than deep code customization. I deployed the app with Vercel, set up custom DNS routing, and configured Notion as a headless CMS so I could manage content without editing the codebase every time I made a change.

## What I Customized ##

- Added a top navigation bar with external links
- Created embedded galleries in Notion to organize content across the homepage and separate pages (Insights and Projects) for easier browsing as content grows
- Removed unused UI components from the original template (such as the GitHub source link in the top-right corner)
- Added a custom favicon and tweaked the layout and styling to match my personal branding

## Why I Built It ##

My goal was to build a lightweight, easily customizable portfolio that allowed me to focus on storytelling and content creation during my career transition. I wanted to avoid having to make constant commits for small updates like tweaking the About section. This project gave me hands-on experience with modern web deployment tools, basic layout customization, and content strategy using Next.js and Notion.
